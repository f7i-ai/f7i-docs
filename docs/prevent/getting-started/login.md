# Logging into Prevent

Get started with Factory AI Prevent CMMS by logging into your account. Our secure authentication system provides multiple ways to access your maintenance management platform.

## What you'll need

- A modern desktop or mobile browser (we recommend Google Chrome or Firefox)
- Your Factory AI account credentials
- Access to your email for passwordless authentication (optional)
- A registered passkey device for advanced authentication (optional)

## Login Process

Factory AI Prevent uses the same secure authentication system as Predict, providing a consistent login experience across all Factory AI products.

### Step 1: Navigate to Login

**For Predict customers accessing Prevent:**
1. Navigate to `https://[customer-domain].f7i.ai/login`
2. You can find your customer domain in the sign-in instructions sent via email
3. After login, you'll have access to both Predict and Prevent features

**For Prevent-only customers:**
1. Navigate to `https://app.f7i.ai/login`
2. Use your Factory AI Prevent account credentials

### Step 2: Enter Your Email

1. Enter your email address in the email field
2. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next step

The system will automatically check for available authentication methods for your account.

### Step 3: Authentication Method

After entering your email, the system checks what authentication methods are available for your account:

#### Biometric Authentication (If Available)

If you have biometric authentication set up on your account, the system will automatically prompt you to authenticate using your biometrics:

1. Your browser will prompt you to use your registered biometric authentication
2. Use your fingerprint, face ID, or security key as configured
3. You'll be automatically signed in upon successful authentication

If biometric authentication fails or times out, you'll be redirected to the password authentication step.

#### Password Authentication (Default)

If you don't have biometric authentication set up, or if biometric authentication fails, you'll see the password authentication screen:

1. Enter your password in the password field
2. Click **Continue with Password** to sign in

From this screen, you also have additional authentication options:

##### Email OTP (Passwordless Login)
1. Click **Sign in without password** 
2. **Re-enter your email address** when prompted
3. Click **Send Email Code**
4. You'll receive an **8-digit code** via email
5. Enter the code to complete authentication

##### Forgot Password
1. Click **Forgot your password?**
2. **Re-enter your email address** when prompted  
3. Click **Send Reset Code**
4. Check your email for password reset instructions
5. Follow the link to create a new password

#### SSO (Single Sign-On)

If your organization has SSO configured:

1. From the password step, click **SSO**
2. You'll be redirected to your organization's identity provider
3. Sign in with your corporate credentials
4. You'll be redirected back to Factory AI Prevent

:::info Password Requirements

### Email Verification (8-Digit Code)

When using Email OTP (passwordless login):

1. After re-entering your email address, check your email for an **8-digit verification code**
2. Enter the 8-digit code in the verification field
3. Click **Verify** to complete authentication

## First-Time Login

If this is your first time logging in:

1. Use the temporary credentials sent in your welcome email
2. You'll be prompted to set a new password
3. Follow the password requirements shown above
4. Once completed, you'll be redirected to the Prevent dashboard

## Accessing Different Products

After successful authentication, your available features depend on your subscription:

**For Predict customers (customer-domain.f7i.ai):**
- **Prevent CMMS**: Navigate to the work orders, assets, and maintenance features
- **Predict Monitoring**: Switch to predictive maintenance and sensor monitoring
