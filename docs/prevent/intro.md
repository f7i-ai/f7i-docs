# Factory AI Prevent

Factory AI Prevent is a comprehensive Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) that helps you organize, track, and optimize all your maintenance activities. Streamline your maintenance workflows, manage assets, and ensure compliance with industry standards.

## What is Prevent?

Prevent is designed to replace spreadsheets, paper-based systems, and fragmented maintenance processes with a centralized, digital solution. Built on **Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) principles**, Prevent takes a systematic approach to determining the most effective maintenance strategies for your assets.

### RCM-Based Approach

Factory AI Prevent implements proven RCM methodology to help you:

- **Focus on Asset Functions**: Understand what each asset is supposed to do
- **Identify Failure Modes**: Determine how assets can fail and why
- **Assess Consequences**: Evaluate the impact of failures on safety, environment, operations, and costs
- **Select Optimal Strategies**: Choose the most effective maintenance approach for each situation
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use data and performance feedback to optimize maintenance decisions
