# Work Order Management

Work orders are the heart of your CMMS operations. Learn how to create, assign, track, and complete maintenance tasks efficiently using Factory AI Prevent.

## What are Work Orders?

Work orders are formal requests for maintenance work that need to be completed. They contain all the information a technician needs to perform the task, including:

- **Task description** and detailed instructions
- **Asset or location** where work needs to be performed
- **Priority level** and deadline
- **Required parts and materials**
- **Assigned technician** or team
- **Estimated time** and actual completion time
- **Safety requirements** and procedures

## Work Order Lifecycle

### 1. Request/Creation
- Work orders can be created by anyone with appropriate permissions
- Requests can come from inspections, employee reports, or scheduled maintenance
- System can auto-generate work orders from preventive maintenance schedules

### 2. Planning & Scheduling
- Maintenance planner reviews and prioritizes requests
- Resources (technicians, parts, tools) are allocated
- Work is scheduled based on priority and resource availability

### 3. Assignment
- Work orders are assigned to specific technicians or teams
- Technicians receive notifications and can access work orders on mobile devices
- All required information is provided before work begins

### 4. Execution
- Technicians perform the maintenance work
- Progress updates and time tracking are recorded
- Photos and notes can be added during execution

### 5. Completion & Review
- Work is completed and documented
- Parts usage and labor time are recorded
- Quality control review may be performed before closing
