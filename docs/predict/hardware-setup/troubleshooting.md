# Troubleshooting

## A gateway is offline
1. Power cycle the device, by unplugging the power cable, and plugging it back in.
1. Both the **orange** and **blue** LEDs should turn on.
1. Then the **orange** LED should remain solid.
1. If sensors are waiting to communicate with the gateway, the **blue** LED will turn on.

If the LED is solid **green** or **orange** LED is flashing slowly, please check the modem.

## A modem is offline
There are two types of modems, the portable Telstra 4GX modem and the high-temperature modem (located in the oven hall and mounted externally to the enclosure.)

### Telstra 4GX modem is offline
1. After troubleshooting the gateway, and you see either a solid green or orange LED flashing slowly, restart the modem. 
1. The power switch is located at the top right side (between the power supply.) The modem will confirm you want to shut down the device. 
1. Press OK. 
1. After the device has shut down, press and hold the power button until you see the Telstra logo again.

### High-temp modem is offline
1. Power cycle the device
