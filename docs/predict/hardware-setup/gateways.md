# Gateways

Sensors connect to gateways using bluetooth. To maximise the range and signal strength between the two devices, we suggest:
- Mount the gateways 2 meters off the ground.
- Ensure the distance between the sensor and gateway is no more than 20 meters.
- Install the gateways outside of metal cabinets

## Specifications
The gateways are IP65 rated and require 5V 2A power source.
