## Setting Up Passkeys (Biometric Authentication)

To enable the fastest and most secure login experience, you can set up passkeys for passwordless biometric authentication. This allows you to sign in using your fingerprint, Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, or hardware security keys.

### What are Passkeys?

Passkeys are a modern, secure authentication method that replaces passwords with cryptographic keys stored on your devices. They provide:

- **Enhanced security**: No passwords to steal or phish
- **Faster login**: Authenticate with a touch or glance
- **Cross-device sync**: Use the same passkey across your devices (depending on your device ecosystem)
- **Privacy protection**: Your biometric data never leaves your device

### Setting Up Your First Passkey

To set up passkey authentication after your initial login:

1. **Access Security Settings**:
   - Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Security** in the Predict interface
   - Or go directly to `/predict/settings/security`

2. **Add New Passkey**:
   - In the "Passwordless Authentication" section, click **"Add New Passkey"**
   - Enter an optional nickname to identify your device (e.g., "MacBook Touch ID", "YubiKey", "Phone Fingerprint")
   - Click **"Register Passkey"**

3. **Complete Device Authentication**:
   - Your browser will prompt you to authenticate using your device's available methods:
     - **Touch ID/Face ID** (Mac/iOS devices)
     - **Windows Hello** (Windows devices with biometric sensors)
     - **Fingerprint scanner** (Android devices)
     - **Hardware security key** (YubiKey, etc.)
   - Follow the prompts to complete registration

4. **Confirmation**:
   - Once registered, your passkey will appear in the security settings
   - You can now use this passkey for future logins

### Supported Devices and Methods

#### Platform Authenticators (Built-in)
- **macOS**: Touch ID, Face ID (on supported Macs)
- **iOS**: Touch ID, Face ID
- **Windows**: Windows Hello (fingerprint, face recognition, PIN)
- **Android**: Fingerprint, face unlock, screen lock

#### Hardware Security Keys
- **YubiKey** (USB-A, USB-C, NFC, Lightning)
- **Google Titan Security Key**
- **Modern security keys** (FIDO2-compatible)
- **Hardware authenticators** (CTAP2-compliant)

### Managing Your Passkeys

From the Security Settings page, you can:

- **View all registered passkeys** with their nicknames and registration dates
- **Rename passkeys** to help identify them (click the edit icon)
- **Remove passkeys** you no longer use (click the trash icon)
- **See device types** (Hardware Key, Device Biometric, Security Key)
- **Check last used dates** for security monitoring

### Using Passkeys for Login

Once set up, passkeys work automatically:

1. Enter your email on the login page
2. If you have passkeys registered, you'll be **automatically prompted** to authenticate
3. Use your biometric method or security key when prompted
4. You'll be signed in immediately upon successful authentication

If passkey authentication fails or times out, you'll automatically fall back to the password authentication screen.

### Best Practices

- **Register multiple passkeys**: Set up passkeys on different devices for backup access
- **Use descriptive nicknames**: "MacBook Touch ID", "iPhone Face ID", "Work YubiKey"
- **Keep passkeys active**: Regularly use your registered devices to ensure they remain functional
- **Remove old devices**: Delete passkeys for devices you no longer use

### Troubleshooting Passkey Setup

**Browser not prompting for passkey registration**
- Ensure you're using a modern browser (Chrome 67+, Firefox 60+, Safari 14+, Edge 18+)
- Check that your device supports biometric authentication
- Verify browser permissions for authentication

**Biometric authentication not working**
- Ensure your device's biometric sensors are configured and working
- Check that you're signed into your device's biometric system
- Try using a different authentication method (PIN, pattern, password)

**Hardware key not recognized**
- Ensure your security key supports modern authentication standards
- Try different USB ports or connections
- Check for firmware updates for your security key

### Security Notes

- **Your biometric data never leaves your device** - only cryptographic signatures are sent
- **Passkeys are unique per website** - they cannot be used to track you across sites
- **Devices store passkeys securely** - they're protected by your device's secure enclave
- **No shared secrets** - even Factory AI cannot access your passkey data
