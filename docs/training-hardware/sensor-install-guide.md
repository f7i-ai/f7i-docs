# Sensor Install Guide

## General Guidance

The ideal sensor mounting location is based on:

- Vibration path (shorter is better)
- Casing or solid (less attenuation)
- Available space
## Installation steps

1. Clean surface using isopropyl wipes
2. Dry and remove lint using the microfibre cloth
    
    :::tip
    If you are mounting multiple sensors close to each other, clean all the areas first. So you can maximise the number of sensors you apply adhesive to, before the tip dries out.

3. Verify mounting position will work (place sensor in location without adhesive)
    1. Is there enough space?
    2. Is there enough contact between sensor and machine? particularly for curved surfaces
    3. Check the orientation of the sensor - x,y,z (marked on the sensor itself)
4. Apply Loctite sparing on the underside of the sensor, avoiding the metal circle in the middle (temperature sensor) - see photos for further guidance.
5. Affix sensor to the surface, holding the sensor for 15-30 seconds (depending on whether the surface is curved)
6. **Factory AI** will verify whether the sensor can connect to the gateway
