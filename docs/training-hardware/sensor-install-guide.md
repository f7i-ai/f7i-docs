# Sensor Install Guide

## Importance of Sensor Positioning

The positioning of sensors is crucial as it directly influences their effectiveness in identifying specific types of failures. Additionally, the reliability of anomaly detection is highly dependent on the quality of data collected, which is, in turn, a function of where the sensor is placed.

## Recommendations for Placement
Optimal sensor placement is determined by:

- Proximity to vibration source (closer is preferable)
- Mounting on a rigid surface (for minimal signal loss)
- Space availability for installation.

## Examples
### Example 1 - Primary, secondary, tertiary
The blue line shows the distance to the vibration source.
The following image of a roller bearing with the primary (green), secondary (yellow) and tertiary (green) locations marked.

### Example 2 - Multiple sensors, to detect different failures
Sensors installed to detect the gearbox and motor failures.

### Example 3 - Multiple sensors, to detect different failures
Sensors installed on the bearings and gearbox

### Example 4 - When space is limited

In some cases, space constraints prevent ideal sensor placement on machines like the small motor and fan shown here. This can result in less accurate alerts from these sensors.

## Installation Steps

1. Clean surface using isopropyl wipes
2. Dry and remove lint using the microfibre cloth
    
    :::tip
    If you are mounting multiple sensors close to each other, clean all the areas first. So you can maximise the number of sensors you apply adhesive to, before the tip dries out.

3. Verify mounting position will work (place sensor in location without adhesive)
    1. Is there enough space?
    2. Is there enough contact between sensor and machine? particularly for curved surfaces
    3. Check the orientation of the sensor - x,y,z (marked on the sensor itself)
4. Apply Loctite sparing on the underside of the sensor, avoiding the metal circle in the middle (temperature sensor) - see photos for further guidance.
5. Affix sensor to the surface, holding the sensor for 15-30 seconds (depending on whether the surface is curved)
6. **Factory AI** will verify whether the sensor can connect to the gateway
