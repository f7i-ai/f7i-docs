# Analysing Data

## Overview
We currently offer two views of the chart data. At the asset view and on a sensor view.

## Asset Charts
Allow you to compare data across an asset. This is useful to compare data on different sides of an asset.

## Filtering data
By default, all data is shown, to filter for a more recent or specific time period, use the calendar or quick filters.
